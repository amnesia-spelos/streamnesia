# Contributing to Streamnesia

First off, thank you for considering contributing to Streamnesia! 🧡  
Whether you're here to code, report bugs, improve documentation, suggest ideas, or just lurk — **you are welcome**.

We believe **everyone has something to bring**, and we’re building this project together, one payload, one feature, one good idea at a time.

## Getting Started

1. **Read through open Issues** — especially ones labeled `good first issue` if you're new.

2. **Fork this repository** ➔ create a new branch ➔ work ➔ and submit a Pull Request.

3. **Be clear in your Pull Request** — explain the *why* of your change, not just the *what*.

If you're not sure *how* to get started, check out the [Streamnesia Wiki](https://github.com/amnesia-spelos/streamnesia/wiki) — we have beginner-friendly guides coming!

## Code Style and Requirements

- We're building in **.NET 9**, mainly with C# and ASP.NET.
- Try to keep your code clean, simple, and documented when needed.
- No stress if you're unsure — we review and collaborate.
- We all had to start somehow. Don't worry if your work doesn't feel quite production-ready, we will help you out or even take it from wherever you decide to leave it.

## Ground Rules

💬 **Be kind.** No gatekeeping. No question is stupid.

🛠 **Work in small pieces.** Small PRs are easier to review and faster to merge.

📖 **Document as you go.** Comments, explanations, even quick notes in the Pull Request help everyone.

🌱 **Patience is appreciated.** We’re all learning and building something cool together!
