Streamnesia is a "Chaos Mod", meaning it changes what happens during your playthrough of the game. Your screen can be upside down for a minute, or maybe all doors unlock.

## Payloads

üì¶ By default, the application downloads a collection of community-made payloads. If you would like to browse them, or if you would like to contribute, see the [streamnesia-payloads repository](https://github.com/amnesia-spelos/streamnesia-payloads).

## Install & Play

1. See the [Release Page](https://github.com/amnesia-spelos/streamnesia/releases) and download a build of the mod
2. ‚ö†Ô∏è This section is still work in progress and the installation instructions will be updated with the new 3.0 release, where the flow will change

## Contributing

üéâ If you would like to contribute to this project, stay tuned. A contributing guide is being worked on, as well as onboarding materials and good first issues.
